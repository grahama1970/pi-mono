Space systems provide critical capabilities that power global industries and enable several facets of everyday life. During a conflict, adversaries may seek to deceive, deny, disrupt, degrade, or destroy those capabilities. Cyberattacks are a complex but effective and increasingly prevalent attack vector in the space domain. To counter cyber threats, cybersecurity and space operations are becoming inextricably linked. Though spacecraft have historically been considered relatively safe from cyber threats, they are squarely in the crosshairs within the modern threat landscape.

Cybersecurity matrices have become an industry-standard approach for providing a knowledge base of adversary behaviors, helping visualize and categorize threats, and serving as a taxonomy for adversarial actions across the attack lifecycle for a number of industry sectors. However, there has traditionally been no framework dedicated to address cyber threats to the spacecraft or space vehicles that are critical enablers of many of those sectors and important facets of daily life.

To fill this gap, The Aerospace Corporation (Aerospace) developed the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) cybersecurity framework, the first cybersecurity threat identification and response framework purposefully designed to help spacecraft developers, owners, and operators outpace space-cyber threats.

Cybersecurity matrices have become an industry standard approach for providing a knowledge base of adversary behaviors and serve as a taxonomy for adversarial actions across the attack lifecycle. The Aerospace Corporation created the Space Attack Research and Tactic Analysis (SPARTA) matrix to address the information and communication barriers that hinder the identification and sharing of space-cyber-Tactic, Techniques, and Procedures (TTP). SPARTA attempts to aggregate unclassified research from academia, Federally Funded Research and Development Centers, and space cyber professionals into a single pane of glass to better educate the space community on TTPs while also identifying countermeasures within SPARTA.


**Acquisition/Procurement Professionals** looking to bolster RFPs, contracts, and statements of work with explicit security-focused requirements for acquired spacecraft systems and components.

**Space System Developers** that need to understand threats and the countermeasures necessary to defend against them, enabling the engineering of protections throughout the development and operational lifecycle of their mission.

**Defensive Cyber Operators** tasked with building monitoring solutions and measuring how effective systems/operators are at detecting malicious activity within their specific space system.

**Threat Intelligence Analysts and Researchers** looking for an industry standard taxonomy for tagging malicious events/incidents to improve reporting, information sharing, and historical tracking of events.

**Cybersecurity Assessors** tasked with evaluating and testing mission systems can utilize SPARTA to develop attack chains against their systems.

**Risk Managers & Compliance Officers** responsible for identifying, implementing, or evaluating a security control package for a spacecraft.

**Educators/Researchers** looking to expand the footprint of space-cyber knowledge to a wider audience and raise the bar on what is considered common knowledge across the industry.

Aerospace recognized that a dedicated security framework would help space developers and network defenders understand and address unique space-cyber threats. Introduced in 2022, SPARTA aggregates unclassified information and research from academia, space-cyber professionals, and federally funded research and development centers into a single resource to better educate the space community about how spacecraft may be compromised via cyber means, while also identifying associated countermeasures.

SPARTA, like preceding security matrices that inspired it, documents possible attack chains and visually organizes cyber tactics, techniques and sub-techniques (commonly referred to as “TTPs” that may compromise spacecraft. SPARTA catalogs TTPs that are either theoretically possible or have been proven in laboratories, on-orbit exercises, and hacking workshops, as well as countermeasures spacecraft can implement to outpace cyber threats.

- Tactics represent the threat actor’s tactical goal and the reason(s) they are performing a technique. For example, a threat actor may want to achieve initial access on a spacecraft via cyber means. Other tactics include reconnaissance, resource development, execution, defense evasion, exfiltration, lateral movement, and impact.
- Techniques represent “how” a threat actor achieves a tactical goal by performing a threat action. For example, a threat actor may exploit trusted relationships to achieve initial access. SPARTA maps a range of techniques that threat actors can use to execute tactics.
- Sub-techniques represent a variation or more specific instance of the threat actor’s behavior used to achieve a goal. Sub-techniques typically describe behavior at lower levels than a technique and are considered children of the parent technique. For example, a threat actor may compromise mission collaborators (academia, international, etc.) to achieve their initial access.


At the top of the SPARTA website there exists labels to guide the user experience.


And on the main landing page the SPARTA Framework exists, where all known Tactics, Techniques and Sub Techniques can be seen:


Expanding the drop-down menus at the top reveals the following:





There is a search bar to help users find information easily. The example below shows some results when searching for information on SPARTA Techniques:


**Tactics** represent the threat actor’s tactical goal and the reason(s) they are performing a technique. For example, a threat actor may want to achieve initial access on a spacecraft via cyber means. Other tactics include reconnaissance, resource development, execution, defense evasion, exfiltration, lateral movement, and impact.

The SPARTA Tactics page provides detailed information on Tactics with associated Techniques and Sub Techniques that help achieve the goal of the Tactic. On the left-hand side there is a menu layout to help users isolate information for each Tactic.

For example, the Reconnaissance Tactic has the primary Technique of Gathering Spacecraft Design Information which has several Sub Techniques such as Software Design:

**Techniques** represent “how” a threat actor achieves a tactical goal by performing a threat action. For example, a threat actor may exploit trusted relationships to achieve initial access. SPARTA maps a range of techniques that threat actors can use to execute tactics.

The Techniques page follows the same navigation pane style as the Tactics, allowing users to easily isolate information on Techniques.

**Sub-techniques** represent a variation or more specific instance of the threat actor’s behavior used to achieve a goal. Sub-techniques typically describe behavior at lower levels than a technique and are considered children of the parent technique. For example, the Software Design Sub Technique has the Parent Technique of Gather Spacecraft Design Information:

Nearly every technique and sub-technique within SPARTA has an assigned Notional Risk Score (NRS). The intention of NRS is to provide practitioners with a starting point for space cyber risk management, from which they can apply specific details (e.g., a reference architecture) to tailor the NRS to better represent their system.

The scores are derived from the resulting impact and likelihood of the SPARTA technique on a 5x5 risk matrix. The matrix provides a risk score with respect to an assessed impact score from 1 to 5 (the x-axis) and a likelihood score from 1 to 5 (the y-axis); the risk scores are shown in the respective cells of the matrix and reflect the joint effect of impact and likelihood, according to the 5×5 matrix defined in NASA-S3001: Guidance for Risk Management.

Risk scores range from 1 to 25 but are not the product of likelihood and impact. The scores are a result of which cell the technique falls under after using the respective 1 to 5 score for both likelihood and impact. Risk scores ranging from 1 to 10 are considered low (green), 11 to 19 considered medium (yellow), and 20 to 25 considered high (red). Each technique displays three distinct NRS values based on the criticality of the hypothetical system in question. Ranging from 1-25, each of these three distinct values are presented on the applicable SPARTA TTP pages as Notional Risk (H | M | L): High Criticality System Risk # | Medium Criticality System Risk # | Low Criticality System Risk #.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Indicators of Behavior (IOBs) play pivotal roles in threat detection and mitigation. However, the distinct characteristics of these indicators and their applications often require nuanced understanding, especially within complex environments like space systems. The initial development and spearheading of the IOB work in SPARTA was funded by the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Science and Technology Directorate to advance proactive detection capabilities tailored to the unique needs of the space domain.


-
**Unauthorized and Anomalous Command Execution (UACE)**UACE IOBs focus on detecting unauthorized, anomalous, or malicious command executions targeting spacecraft operations. It includes monitoring commands issued outside expected time windows, deviations from baseline configurations, and replay attacks. UACE also covers unauthorized actions during safe-mode, where reduced security measures can be exploited. These IOBs help spacecraft operators identify and respond to command-related anomalies that may jeopardize mission integrity.

-
**Unauthorized Cryptographic Key Usage and Encryption Bypass (UCEB)**UCEB IOBs target unauthorized access, misuse, or tampering with cryptographic keys and encryption mechanisms. Monitoring includes repeated cryptographic key usage from unexpected locations, improper access to decryption keys, and any unexpected changes to encryption configurations. UCEB IOBs are critical for detecting persistent access attempts or data exfiltration efforts that exploit weakened encryption practices.

-
**Communication Security and Network Exploitation (CSNE)**CSNE IOBs detect unauthorized access and exploitation targeting spacecraft communication channels. They include monitoring network traffic from rogue ground stations, unexpected protocols, or IP addresses, as well as bandwidth spikes or communication link anomalies that might indicate jamming or network exploitation. By focusing on communication integrity, CSNE IOBs help detect potential command injection and data interception threats.

-
**Authentication and RF Signal Integrity Threats (ARFS)**ARFS IOBs focus on threats to authentication mechanisms and RF communication integrity. This includes monitoring for abnormal authentication attempts, RF signal manipulation, and replay attacks. This category is vital for identifying electronic warfare tactics designed to compromise spacecraft control through signal jamming or spoofing.

-
**GNSS and Time Manipulation Threats (GNTM)**GNTM IOBs focus on GNSS and timing data, which are critical for spacecraft navigation and synchronization. This category includes IOBs for detecting GNSS interference, time spoofing, and irregularities in time synchronization that may indicate manipulation. Monitoring for GNSS signal delays, signal-to-noise ratio drops, or unauthorized time adjustments helps maintain mission accuracy and stability.

-
**Spacecraft Memory Integrity and Resource Exploitation Attacks (MIRE)**MIRE IOBs focus on unauthorized memory access or modification, including attacks on flash memory, EEPROM, and boot processes. They also cover resource exploitation tactics, such as memory exhaustion or the insertion of malicious code into boot memory. Detecting these threats helps protect critical system functions from disruption and unauthorized control.

-
**Watchdogs and Register Exploitation (WTRE)**WTRE IOBs address threats to watchdog timers and critical subsystem registers. IOBs include detecting unauthorized access or manipulation of watchdog functions that may disrupt spacecraft stability. Monitoring for changes to critical registers or timing inconsistencies helps identify potential sabotage or subsystem compromise.

-
**Software Integrity and Unauthorized Updates (SIUU)**SIUU IOBs detect the manipulation or unauthorized modification of flight software, including malicious updates or firmware tampering. Monitoring includes checking software integrity, update validation, and unauthorized software modifications. This category helps ensure that software configurations remain secure throughout the spacecraft’s operational life.

-
**Spacecraft Sensor Manipulation and System Resource Exploitation (SMSR)**SMSR IOBs address threats to spacecraft sensors, which are critical for attitude control and system monitoring. SMSR IOBs detect manipulation of sensor data or attempts to exploit system resources. Examples include false telemetry injection or sensor spoofing that may mislead spacecraft operations. Early detection helps maintain accurate control and prevents resource depletion.

-
**Data Integrity and Storage Exploitation Threats (DISE)**DISE IOBs focus on maintaining data integrity and protecting onboard storage from unauthorized modification or data corruption. DISE IOBs monitor file system integrity, data manipulation attempts, and unauthorized data deletions. By securing critical data, spacecraft operators can protect mission continuity and prevent data loss.



One of the key applications for IOBs is in building and enhancing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDSs) for spacecraft. Some IDSs solutions rely only on signature-based detection via IOCs, which may not suffice in a rapidly evolving threat landscape. With IOBs, IDS can be properly tuned to detect behavioral anomalies, such as unauthorized command execution during safe-mode or unexpected memory modifications. By integrating these IOBs into onboard IDSs, spacecraft operators gain the ability to detect not just known threats but also emerging patterns that could indicate compromise. This level of detection is critical for maintaining mission assurance in the face of sophisticated cyber adversaries.

Integrating IOBs directly into spacecraft, we can address emerging cyber threats and ensure continuous protection, even when communication with ground stations is delayed or interrupted. The development of onboard intrusion detection will become a critical piece in space system defense strategies, helping protect against malicious activities, system manipulation, or protocol-based attacks that can compromise spacecraft operations. Given how quickly an attack can manifest onboard, ground operators may not have time to intervene before they lose control of the spacecraft. In this evolving threat landscape, the move towards on-orbit, autonomous cyber defense capabilities is essential to safeguard future space missions. Having documented IOBs will greatly enhance the detection, correlation, and response capabilities of these platforms by monitoring for specific malicious or anomalous behaviors in spacecraft operations.

To effectively leverage IOBs in intrusion detection, we chose to document them using the Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX) format. STIX is particularly well-suited for capturing behavioral indicators because its flexible and expressive structure allows for detailed representation of complex threat patterns. By using STIX, we provide a standardized way to define IOBs that can be directly integrated into IDS implementations. This approach not only enhances consistency but also supports the creation of detection logic. Feedback from the community has highlighted that the STIX format, with its Boolean and pattern-matching capabilities, greatly facilitates building automated detection rules, helping spacecraft software developers quickly build detections for indicators.

For these IOBs to be effective in detecting threats or anomalies in spacecraft operations, it is essential that the necessary data is available for analysis. Without access to critical telemetry, network traffic logs, process activity, and other system data, even the most sophisticated detection logic will be rendered useless. The spacecraft must ensure that this data is collected, transmitted, and stored in a reliable manner so that it can be analyzed in real-time. This includes having robust logging mechanisms in place to capture communication protocols, system resource usage, file integrity, and command execution events. Data availability is the foundation of any detection and response strategy and without it, the visibility needed to identify threats is impaired, leaving the spacecraft vulnerable to undetected attacks.

Educating the space community on spacecraft tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) is one goal of SPARTA, but equally important is ensuring space system engineers are informed about countermeasures available to aid in mitigation.

While TTPs are important to understand a threat actor’s “why” and “how,” ensuring relevant technical and administrative countermeasures are in place is imperative. According to NIST, countermeasures are defined as “protective measures prescribed to meet the security objectives, i.e., confidentiality, integrity, and availability, specified for an information system. Safeguards may include security features, management controls, personnel security, and security of physical structures, areas, and devices”.

In the context of a spacecraft, some example countermeasures include protecting spacecraft design information from exfiltration, applying more rigor to the hardware/software supply chain, ensuring communication security (COMSEC) and/or transmission security (TRANSEC), or implementing better segmentation for mission-critical data flows onboard the spacecraft bus.

SPARTA provides countermeasures against tactics and their supporting techniques. These countermeasures will be enhanced over time as new TTPs are published and space-cyber defensive technology matures.

SPARTA countermeasures are grounded in experience and industry standards, drawing from sources like Security and Privacy Controls for Information Systems and Organizations (NIST SP 800–53 Rev. 5), whenever those controls are relevant in space-cyber contexts. SPARTA leverages The Aerospace Corporation’s defense-in-depth (DiD) model for space systems, as described in the paper, Cybersecurity Protections for Spacecraft: A Threat Based Approach.

As is the case with the tactics and techniques, a pane on the left-side of the page can be used to navigate this content, which is sorted according to the DiD layers:


Each Countermeasure is mapped to relevant NIST control(s), technique(s) and Indicators of Behavior (IOBs)

Using the above example of the TEMPEST Countermeasure, if you were to scroll down on the web page and interact with the “Mappings” button, you would see all the controls the Countermeasure is mapped to:

Users can toggle various supplemental content with the buttons on the page as shown below.

Lastly, the “Sample Requirements” button will reveal sample acquisition language/engineering requirements (shall statements) that could be used to help design a system feature that meets the intent of the countermeasure:

Securing space systems against modern cyber threats requires a shift from checklist-based compliance toward threat-driven prioritization. Unlike traditional IT systems, spacecraft are highly resource-constrained, operate in harsh environments, and often cannot easily be patched or updated once deployed. SPARTA has been expanded with a prioritization method that aligns countermeasure selection with both threat relevance and implementation feasibility across the space domain.

To support mission owners, integrators, and security teams, the SPARTA team developed a countermeasure (CM) prioritization approach. This approach evaluates each CM using a scoring formula that integrates **Efficacy**, **Feasibility**, and **Cost**, producing a prioritization score that reflects both operational impact and programmatic risk. Countermeasures with low scores are considered high priority, meaning they provide a strong security return on investment and are achievable given typical space constraints.

The **efficacy** dimension focuses on how effectively a given countermeasure can prevent, disrupt, or detect known adversary behaviors. Rather than treating all adversary techniques equally, the approach incorporates the Notional Risk Score (NRS) for each technique, which reflects its relative criticality (i.e., impact and likelihood). For example, techniques associated with irreversible mission loss (e.g., unauthorized deorbiting) are assigned higher NRS values. Countermeasures are then scored based on the average NRS of the techniques they mitigate, ensuring those that defend against high-risk behaviors are weighted more heavily.

This technique-CM mapping is grounded in SPARTA’s existing knowledge base, which traces adversary behavior from high-level tactics (e.g., Initial Access) down to concrete techniques and sub-techniques. For instance, a countermeasure like CM0031: Authentication may mitigate a broad range of high-NRS techniques, including Replay: Command Packets, unauthorized commanding from Rogue External Entity. By aligning countermeasure impact with known TTPs, the prioritization approach directly connects defenses to adversary tradecraft.

The **feasibility** component accounts for the technical and architectural realities of spacecraft. Implementation feasibility was assessed based on several criteria, including generic spacecraft compatibility, spaceflight heritage, and technology readiness level (TRL). Many countermeasures that are standard in terrestrial systems may be infeasible onboard due to SWaP (Size, Weight, and Power) limitations, radiation hardening requirements, or flight certification constraints.

Feasibility was assigned using subject matter expert judgment across a normalized scale. A CM that can be implemented using mature tooling, with minimal impact on the mission architecture (e.g., static code analysis or secure boot) would score highly. Conversely, CMs that require significant redesign, custom ASIC/FPGA development, or have only been demonstrated in lab environments may receive lower feasibility scores. The goal was to ensure the approach reflects realistic adoption potential, not just theoretical applicability.

**Cost**, in this context, captures the full lifecycle burden of implementing a countermeasure within a space program. This includes estimated labor required for integration, software and hardware modifications, verification and validation activities, and indirect impacts such as schedule disruption, long-lead item procurement, or external coordination with partners or suppliers. Recognizing that exact cost modeling is highly program-specific and often infeasible early in the lifecycle, the approach was to use a generalized 1-to-4 magnitude scale (e.g., $, $$, $$$, $$$$) to represent relative cost impact across missions.

For example, a Tier 1 countermeasure like CM0012: Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) typically incurs a low cost, as it can often be integrated with existing build and release processes using mature tooling. Similarly, CM0002: COMSEC is widely understood, operationally supported, and already part of many program baselines which makes it less burdensome to implement. In contrast, countermeasures such as CM0061: Power Masking or CM0067: Smart Contracts may involve significant architectural redesign, low-TRL components, or custom hardware/software dependencies which drives both cost and integration complexity higher.

These cost scores are not intended to provide precise budgeting figures, but rather serve as a coarse-grained, mission-agnostic filter to help with the prioritization process by identifying which mitigations are most cost-effective in the context of their own risk profiles and system architectures.

The combined prioritization score is calculated using the formula:

**(Feasibility × Cost) / Efficacy**

This structure intentionally rewards CMs that are both high-impact and realistic to implement. A low score indicates that a countermeasure is both operationally valuable and feasible within typical mission constraints, making it a strong candidate for prioritization. Conversely, a CM that is highly effective but too costly or complex for most missions will score lower in priority.

After scoring, countermeasures were grouped into three tiers:

-
**Tier 1 CMs**are foundational defenses that are both effective and widely implementable. These include static analysis, authentication enforcement, COMSEC, SBOMs, and monitoring of critical telemetry. Missions across all sectors are strongly encouraged to implement these wherever applicable. -
**Tier 2 CMs**are valuable but often more complex, costly, or context-specific. Examples include onboard message encryption, EMSEC, or cyber-safe mode. These CMs should be evaluated in light of system architecture, mission duration, and operational risk tolerance. -
**Tier 3 CMs**include cutting-edge or niche protections that often have high cost, low TRL, or limited general applicability. These include deception technologies, stealth technology, or proliferated constellations. While not suitable for all missions, Tier 3 CMs may be critical for high-value assets or future capabilities.

In addition to tiering, each countermeasure was annotated with environmental applicability which means whether it is relevant to onboard spacecraft, ground systems, or development pipelines. This helps stakeholders allocate protections based on where the risk resides in their specific architecture. For example, CM0004: Development Environment Security applies primarily to the build pipeline, while CM0040: Shared Resource Leakage and CM0036: Session Termination are applicable onboard.

Ultimately, the SPARTA Countermeasure Prioritization approach bridges the gap between threat intelligence and engineering decision-making. It empowers programs to align their defensive posture with real-world threats while balancing risk, cost, and feasibility. By using a structured, repeatable, and threat-informed methodology, this approach helps ensure that space systems are designed not just with compliance in mind but with cyber survivability at the forefront.

SPARTA requirements translate space-specific adversary TTPs into engineering-grade requirements suitable for space vehicles (SV), acquisition, and mission assurance. Developed from space-specific threat analysis, security engineering principles, and established best practices, these requirements are mapped to NIST SP 800-53 Rev. 5 controls to demonstrate alignment with current federal control language while preserving traceability from adversary behavior to system design outcomes. Each requirement is categorized as technical or procedural using formal requirements engineering principles consistent with INCOSE, NASA, and U.S. Space Force guidance, ensuring clear “shall” language, unambiguous intent, and conceptual verifiability.

Technical requirements define verifiable SV or software behavior, while procedural requirements define governance, processes, documentation, or programmatic controls necessary to sustain mission security.

__Technical Requirement__, a verifiable, product focused “shall” on the spacecraft or its software, written to express need and testable outcome, not method. Quality gate, necessary, unambiguous, singular, feasible, verifiable.

__Design Constraint__(technical), a requirement that intentionally restricts design choices, for example naming a specific algorithm, interface, or mechanism. Allowed when the purpose is to constrain, still judged for clarity and verifiability.__Test Requirement / Validation Criterion__(technical), a requirement that states an acceptance condition or how compliance will be verified, for example “shall be verified by test” or an objective pass or fail condition.__ICD / Standard__(technical), content that belongs in an ICD or standard, for example message layouts, protocol fields, or parameter formats, which the deck says to capture in ICD or standards rather than as enterprise requirements.

__Process / Procedure__(procedural), activities a team performs, for example “conduct analysis,” “monitor,” “train,” or “review,” which the deck separates from product requirements.__Documentation Requirement__(procedural), required plans, architectures, or other documents, which the deck treats as deliverables or artifacts rather than product requirements.__Standards / ICD Development__(procedural), tasks to develop or update standards and interface control documents, separate from product behavior.__Concept of Operations__(ConOps) (procedural), statements about how operators will use or employ the system, which the deck says not to embed as requirements.

Unlike generic IT security controls, SPARTA Requirements are tailored for deterministic, resource-constrained, safety-critical space systems. They support threat-informed engineering, acquisition-ready contract language, control tailoring, and continuous monitoring by explicitly linking SV behavior and governance controls to adversary techniques.

The integration of CWE mappings to SPARTA is paramount in supporting the Secure by Design philosophy. CWE is a class-based category system for hardware and software weaknesses and vulnerabilities. The addition of CWE classes mapped to SPARTA techniques reflects the understanding that all adversary techniques fundamentally target weaknesses within spacecraft. Mapping techniques to CWE classes allows us to establish a clear link between specific attack methods and the underlying weaknesses they exploit.

Each SPARTA Technique is mapped to a CWE Class. This allows developers to better understand what CWE Classes threat actors are likely targeting, and where developers may want an additional level of scrutiny when designing space systems.

As seen above, the “Gather Spacecraft Design Information” technique is mapped to several CWE Classes among 4 levels of priorities. Indicating that for the “Gather Spacecraft Design Information” Technique, an adversary would be looking for these kinds of misconfigurations and vulnerabilities in the design of a spacecraft. The CWE mapping helps guide developers in understanding how an adversary looks for weaknesses in a spacecraft per technique, helping drive home the Secure by Design philosophy.

SPARTA has a number of built in tools to help users work with the vast amount of data contained on the site. Below you will find brief overviews for each.

The SPARTA navigator can be found here. The SPARTA navigator is a tool for creating SPARTA attack chains or highlighting TTPs. It can be used to visualize countermeasure coverage, red/blue team planning, and more. The user can create their own layers in JSON and load them later to visualize attack chains, coverage maps, etc. The most important feature of SPARTA’s Navigator is the ability to export information into Excel. This enables users to select TTPs and then export all of the associated data points for their attack chains, to include the countermeasure(s), associated TTPs/threats, NIST control mappings, and much more.

The SPARTA Navigator page:

To create a new layer simply click the button:

Upon opening a new layer, the following page is loaded:

But to utilize the SPARTA Navigator, first click a TTP to reveal the associated countermeasure(s)/NIST Control(s), in the below example the “Eavesdropping” technique was selected:

Next, scroll down and utilize the toggle button to switch between the countermeasure(s) and NIST controls associated to the TTP(s)

In the below image the countermeasures were toggled on, and the countermeasures associated to the “Eavesdropping” TTP are highlighted in green:

And to see the associated NIST controls, simply click the toggle button:

The countermeasure mapper enables the user to select countermeasure(s) using the Defense-in-Depth view to visually determine their coverage of SPARTA techniques/sub-techniques. This feature is particularly useful when chaining together countermeasures to build a security architecture for the spacecraft. Before selecting any countermeasures, all the techniques/sub-techniques will appear in red but as the user selects a countermeasure, the techniques/sub-techniques turn green indicating some level of coverage and risk reduction. It is important to understand that a single countermeasure typically cannot fully prevent a TTP but it aides in risk reduction for the spacecraft. When finished selecting countermeasures, the user can export the TTP graphic but more importantly the user can export the data to Excel. The Excel workbook will report the selected countermeasures, the TTPs covered as well as the gaps in TTP coverage in respective tabs of the workbook. From a security engineering perspective, this will ensure system designers can better understand where their gaps and potential risk resides.

To create a new layer, simply use the “Create New Layer” button:

When creating a new layer, first select the countermeasure(s) of interest to see their associated TTP(s).

In the demonstration below, the first countermeasure of each category was selected. Each countermeasure selected will become green instead of grey:

To see the impact this has on mitigating TTP(s) simply scroll down:

Notice the significant TTP coverage for the Reconnaissance tactic but there is little to no coverage regarding the other tactics. Remember to reference the below spectrum when analyzing TTP coverage:

The SPARTA control mapper enables the user to select individual NIST controls and enhancements, as well as ISO 27001 requirements/controls using graphical user interface. This feature is particularly useful when chaining together many controls to build a security architecture for the spacecraft.

Before selecting any control, all the techniques/sub-techniques will appear in red but as the user selects control(s), the techniques/sub-techniques turn green indicating some level of coverage and risk reduction. It is important to understand that a single control has little impact on a TTP within SPARTA. Because these controls are more granular than SPARTA countermeasures in general, it will take a multitude of controls to fully mitigate a TTP.

The functionality of the control mapper leverages the relationship between SPARTA countermeasures and controls that have been published under the countermeasure section of SPARTA.

When done selecting the controls, the user can export the TTP graphic but more importantly the user can export the data to Excel. The Excel workbook will report the selected controls, the TTPs covered as well as the gaps in TTP coverage in respective tabs of the workbook. From a security engineering perspective, this will ensure system designers can better understand where their gaps and potential risk resides.

In contrast to the SPARTA countermeasures, there are many more controls from a NIST or ISO perspective. Therefore, users can leverage the JSON creator tool to create their own custom overlays of controls vice manually selecting from the graphical interface.

The SPARTA Control Mapper:

To create a new layer simply interact with the “Create New Layer” button:

When creating a new layer, first select the Control Framework you would like to use for analysis:

After your Control Framework is selected, start by selecting the control(s) you would like to evaluate.

For this demonstration, many controls were selected at random (the selected controls are marked green):

To see how the selected controls provide coverage against TTP(s) simply scroll down:

In this case, the TTP coverage based off of the NIST controls is lacking. Remember to reference the below spectrum to evaluate TTP coverage:

Lastly, if you would like to export data, the SPARTA Control Mapper allows you to do so with JSON, as a PNG, or in an Excel format:

The Spacecraft Mapper enables the user to select different subsystems of a Spacecraft and identify possible SPARTA TTP(s) that could target it, or manifest within that area of the system, while also showing the countermeasures that could be implemented to combat the associated SPARTA TTP(s).

To use the Spacecraft Mapper start by creating a layer:

Next, select a subsystem(s) of a spacecraft to see the associated SPARTA TTP(s) that could lead to a compromise.

In the below example the “Flight Termination System (FTS)” was selected as the part. In blue you can see the part that was selected, in red you can see the possible SPARTA TTP(s):

If you continue to scroll down past the SPARTA TTP(s) you will see the potential countermeasures that apply to the subsystem(s) in green:

As is the case with the other mappers, you can also export your data in JSON, as a PNG, or in an Excel format:

The SPARTA JSON Creator is a tool for creating JSON objects to be used in the various SPARTA mapping tools; Navigator, CM Mapper, and Control Mapper. The user can easily copy/paste SPARTA TTPs, SPARTA Countermeasures, NIST 800-53 Rev 5 IDs, or ISO 27001 IDs into the top text area and convert the data into a specific SPARTA tool format. This JSON can then be downloaded and imported into the tool for editing and creating visuals. The expected format of the controls MUST match the format within the Countermeasure section of SPARTA (NIST, ISO). For example, NIST control must match control family-control number(enhancement number) with no leading zeros. This would look like AC-2(1) and not AC-02(1) or AC-02(01).

For instance, if you wanted to take TTPs and convert them to JSON for use by the navigator, you would simply get a list of the TTPs, delimit them using comma, and paste them into the upper-most text box and use the “Convert to JSON” button like so:

From here you can download the JSON output to a file and upload it into Navigator tool:

Upon uploading the JSON file to the Navigator tool you will see the three SPARTA TTPs are selected:

The Space System Cybersecurity Questionnaire is designed to provide insight into an organization’s cybersecurity capabilities across the entire space system encompassing the space, ground, and user segments. The open-ended, free-form questions aim to elicit detailed responses that explain cybersecurity processes, capabilities, and implementations in use by an organization. Because responses are narrative and not bound to a rigid scoring model, it is recommended that experienced cybersecurity subject matter experts (SMEs) conduct the evaluation to ensure comprehensive interpretation and analysis. Evaluators should also be aware that assessment outcomes may be subjective and influenced by the assessor's experience and expertise.

The questions were developed using industry best practices and threat-informed guidance from The Aerospace Corporation’s TOR-2021-01333 REV A and the SPARTA framework. They focus on essential threats and vulnerabilities outlined in the TOR document and prioritize high-risk techniques identified through SPARTA’s Notional Risk Scores. The goal is to drive a more defensible, threat-aware cybersecurity posture for space missions.

On the questionnaire page you will find a three-column long table. The first column holds the open-ended question, the second column has further details that could be used to guide the questions and get more information, while the third column holds links to informative resources:

In utilizing SPARTA, engineers now have a resource that contains TTPs, threats, and countermeasures to enable the engineering of protections early in the lifecycle, establishing countermeasures to disrupt the attack chains. The following process illustrates how engineers could implement SPARTA into their development cycle:

**Step 1**: Enumerate end-to-end system during all phases of mission development and operations- A combination of Enterprise IT and ICS/OT cyber controls/protections would be applied to the systems enumerated on ground using any of the following resources

**Step 2**: Review each threat, technique and sub-technique and make applicability determination based on your specific mission/system context FOR EACH element identified in Step 1- Example could be the Compromise Boot Memory technique

-
**Step 3**: Evaluate current design choices to identify potential gaps that would leave element(s) vulnerable to applicable threats/techniques (as determined in Step 2) – Consider implementing SPARTA Countermeasures (CM) mapped to applicable techniques where gaps exist in current design- Implementing multiple countermeasures aligns with defense-in-depth principles
- After you select 1 to N number of techniques you would like to mitigate in your system design. Then you select the countermeasures applicable to your design which can be derived into requirement language. The best way to gain access to requirement language is via the Countermeasures that are linked to the technique.

Additional relevant information that can help inform design are the mapped CWEs that appear on the mappings tab for each technique. These are weakness classes from the CWE database that the technique would target during exploitation. Therefore, the system engineer should design out those weaknesses to reduce the likelihood of exploitation by an adversary.

A key driver behind SPARTA is the absence of robust, widely shared cyber incident data for spacecraft. While enterprise networks have decades of documented intrusions and frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to structure cyber threat intelligence (CTI), the space domain is only now emerging as a focus for systematic threat modeling. Spacecraft often depend on bespoke designs, proprietary protocols, and isolated architectures, which makes adversary behaviors harder to document and share.

SPARTA provides the space community with a common language for describing adversary tactics and techniques, enabling CTI to be tracked, reported, and compared across missions and organizations. This improves situational awareness, helps programs identify where they may be vulnerable, and supports consistent reporting of threat activity. As more insights are gained through red-teaming, exercises, and real-world incidents, SPARTA evolves to expand its coverage and refine its fidelity.

The benefit of this approach is that space missions can leverage CTI not only to understand how adversaries operate but also to build proactive defenses. SPARTA makes it possible to connect threat behaviors to countermeasures, map them to standards and controls, and share intelligence across the community in a structured way. This ensures that spacecraft protection is informed by realistic, mission-relevant scenarios and that defenses are continuously updated as the threat landscape evolves.

An example of how this has been performed for IT systems can be seen below where ATT&CK IDs are reported in intel reports and/or CTI.

Groups like the SPACE ISAC have already started reporting incidents and threat activity using SPARTA TTPs to tag the reports, which provides a much needed common language for information sharing.

SPARTA can be used to build realistic, threat-informed scenarios for table-top exercises, red teaming, and simulations. By grounding exercises in documented adversary TTPs, organizations can walk through cyberattack scenarios that mirror real-world threats to space systems, such as jamming, command injection, or compromise of ground stations. This ensures teams practice detecting, responding to, and recovering from authentic adversarial behaviors rather than generic attacks. SPARTA also supports red teams in constructing sophisticated attack chains that span ground, link, and space segments, and provides defenders with a framework to evaluate detection gaps and incident response effectiveness. After each exercise, teams can map observed gaps back to SPARTA techniques, enabling iterative improvement and helping organizations steadily mature their space system security posture.

**Using SPARTA for Table-Top Exercises – Quick Steps**

**Define the Scenario**

- Choose a mission-relevant context (e.g., spacecraft operations disruption, ground station compromise).
- Identify the mission objectives or assets you want to stress-test.

**Select Relevant Techniques**

- Use SPARTA to identify realistic adversary TTPs aligned to your scenario (e.g., IA-0006 Compromise Hosted Payload, EX-0012 Modify On-Board Values, etc.).
- Consider chaining techniques across ground, link, and space to reflect how real adversaries operate.

**Build the Attack Chain**

- Map out the sequence of steps an adversary would take, using SPARTA techniques as building blocks. Tools like Attack Flow can support this analysis.
- Include possible pivot points (e.g., lateral movement from host spacecraft to payload).

**Walk Through the Exercise**

- Have participants discuss how they would detect, respond to, and recover from each step of the attack chain.
- Reference SPARTA countermeasures to highlight potential defenses.

**Capture Indicators & Gaps**

- Note what indicators (telemetry, logs, network events) should have been detected.
- Identify gaps in detection, response procedures, or communications.

**Refine and Iterate**

- Map gaps back to SPARTA techniques to track what wasn’t detected or mitigated.
- Use lessons learned to design follow-up exercises that progressively increase realism.

The SPARTA Team performs various traceability mappings across many different data elements. We pursue these mappings to position SPARTA as a comprehensive reference point, a Rosetta Stone for spacecraft cybersecurity, that unifies diverse sources of knowledge into a single, accessible framework. There is a wealth of excellent work across the cybersecurity community, and our goal is not to reinvent it, but to integrate and connect it where it makes sense. By creating these mappings, SPARTA ensures that engineers, operators, and analysts can cross-reference frameworks, standards, and datasets in one place, enabling more efficient design, assessment, and defensive operations.

Structured Threat Information Expression (STIX™) is a language and serialization format used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI). The SPARTA dataset is available in STIX 2.1.

STIX is a machine-readable format providing access to the SPARTA knowledge base. It is the most granular representation of the SPARTA data, and all other representations are derived from the STIX dataset.

The SPARTA STIX representation is most easily manipulated in Python using the stix2 library. However, because STIX is represented in JSON, other programming languages can easily interact with the raw content.

To download SPARTA you may either make a call to the API directly, or utilize the dropdown menu as described on the website:

For example, STIX/JSON output of SPARTA data looks like the following:

Alternatively, SPARTA can also be exported into Excel. These spreadsheets are dynamically built and provide a more human-accessible view into the knowledge base.
