# /plan

Create YAML task files that `/orchestrate` executes directly. No markdown intermediate.

**Before writing any plan, read `/best-practices-plan`** — it has the rules this skill enforces.

## Workflow

The full pipeline is: `/plan` → `/review-plan` → `/orchestrate`. The agent runs all three
when the user says `/plan`. The user only needs to say `/plan` once.

```
1. /memory recall     — Check if this problem was already solved
2. SKILL DISCOVERY    — Find existing skills that do what's needed (BLOCKING)
3. /assess            — Read the target codebase
4. Identify persona   — WHO uses this? Name them.
5. Decompose          — Break into tasks with runner/backend/mode
6. Output YAML        — Write 0N_TASKS.yaml
7. plan.py --dag      — Show execution DAG to human for approval
8. plan.py --validate — Schema validation
9. /review-plan       — Full validation (claims, routing, blind tests, overlap)
10. If PASS → ask human: "Plan ready. Run /orchestrate?"
11. If human approves → /orchestrate run 0N_TASKS.yaml
```

### Step 2: Skill Discovery (BLOCKING — do NOT skip)

Before writing ANY task, check if an existing skill already does it. The agent MUST NOT
write bespoke code when a skill exists. This is the #1 source of architectural debt.

**How to check:**

```bash
# Search the manifest (fastest — one file, all 225+ skills)
cat ~/.pi/skills-manifest.json | python3 -c "
import json, sys
data = json.load(sys.stdin)
for s in data['skills']:
    d = (s.get('description') or '').lower()
    if any(kw in d for kw in ['cache', 'redis', 'api']):
        print(f'  /{s[\"name\"]}: {s[\"description\"][:100]}')
"

# Or search skill names directly
ls ~/.pi/skills/ | grep -i cache

# Or ask memory
/memory recall "skill:caching" OR "skill:redis"
```

**Decision for each piece of work:**

| Existing skill covers it? | Action |
|---------------------------|--------|
| Yes, fully | CALL the skill. Do NOT rewrite it. |
| Yes, 60%+ | EXTEND the skill. Add what's missing. |
| No match | CREATE new code — but document WHY in capability_overlap. |

Every task in the YAML should map to CALL, EXTEND, or CREATE. If the plan is mostly
CREATE, you haven't looked hard enough. `/review-plan` will flag tasks that overlap
with existing skills as FAIL.

Steps 7-11 happen automatically after writing the YAML. The human only intervenes if
`/review-plan` FAILs (fix the plan) or if they want to amend the DAG before execution.

### If /review-plan FAILs

Triage each failure:

| Failure type | Action |
|---|---|
| Missing field (mode, DoD command) | Fix it yourself — no human input needed |
| Wrong runner/backend | Fix if obvious, ask human if ambiguous |
| Missing capability_overlap | Run `/memory recall` and fill it in |
| Skill overlap detected | Ask human: use existing skill or justify new code? |
| Ambiguous requirements | Use `/interview` for structured choices |
| Claims don't match codebase | Re-read the code with `/assess` |

After fixes, re-run `/review-plan`. Do NOT proceed to `/orchestrate` until PASS.
Do NOT silently skip FAILs — every FAIL must be resolved or explicitly waived by the human.

## Plan Types

Auto-detected from goal text. All types use the same YAML schema.

| Type | Detected When | Pattern |
|------|---------------|---------|
| **code** | No UI keywords | `local` for setup, `subagent-service` for implementation |
| **design** | views, components, TSX, dashboard, UI, React | `/mockup-lab` (Stitch) → `/ux-lab` (code) → `/mockup-lab review` (VLM verify) → `/test-interactions` |
| **hybrid** | Both UI and code keywords | Stitch pipeline for UI views, code tasks in later waves |

### Design Plans

**Rule: The agent NEVER designs UI.** Stitch designs it. The agent codes it.

Design plans MUST specify **device type** (desktop, mobile, tablet). Pass `--device`
to every `/mockup-lab` command. Stitch defaults to mobile if not specified.

For any plan with UI work, each component follows 3 steps:

1. `/mockup-lab` — Stitch generates design, human approves (`--device desktop`)
2. `/ux-lab` — Agent codes React component from approved screenshots
3. `/mockup-lab review` — Gemini VLM verifies implementation matches design

For small changes (colors, spacing, adding a column), skip step 1 and use
`/ux-lab` + `/review-design` directly.

Read `.pi/skills/mockup-lab/design-to-code.yaml` for the detailed checklist.

**DoD for UI tasks must be visual** — "tsc compiles" is not done. Done means
a screenshot shows real data matching the approved design.

```

## Task Fields Reference

### Runner (how the task executes)

| Runner | Use For | Required Fields |
|--------|---------|-----------------|
| `local` | Shell commands (setup, tests, sanity scripts) | `command` |
| `scillm` | One-shot LLM inference (classification, extraction) | `backend`, `mode: one_shot` |
| `subagent-service` | Agent loops (coding, review, design) | `backend`, `mode`, `implementation` or `prompt` |

### Backend (which LLM model)

| Backend | Best For | Cost |
|---------|----------|------|
| `sonnet` | Boilerplate, scaffolding, monitoring, calling existing scripts | Low |
| `opus` | Architecture, novel design, cross-skill composition | High |
| `codex` | Code review, deep analysis, refactoring | Medium |
| `gemini` | Long content, large context, visual tasks | Medium |

**Decision heuristic**: "call existing script and check output" → sonnet. "understand 3 systems and wire them together" → opus. "review this code" → codex.

### Mode (execution style)

| Mode | Use For |
|------|---------|
| `iterative` | Multi-turn agent work (coding, design iteration) |
| `one_shot` | Single LLM inference (classification, extraction) |
| `review` | Review/assessment tasks |

## Usage

```bash
# Emit YAML template
plan.py

# Validate existing plan
plan.py --validate 01_TASKS.yaml

# Visualize execution DAG (waves, parallelism, routing)
plan.py --dag 01_TASKS.yaml

# Output DAG as Mermaid flowchart (for docs/PRs)
plan.py --mermaid 01_TASKS.yaml

# Convert legacy markdown to YAML
plan.py --convert 01_TASKS.md -o 01_TASKS.yaml

# Render YAML as markdown (for human review)
plan.py --render 01_TASKS.yaml

# Add a task to an existing plan (auto-assigns ID, wires deps)
plan.py --add-task 01_TASKS.yaml "title=Run integration tests|runner=local|lane=2|depends_on=2|command=pytest tests/"

# Remove a task (cleans up dangling deps)
plan.py --remove-task 01_TASKS.yaml:3

```

## Pipeline Position

```
/plan → /review-plan → /orchestrate
```

For design plans, the execution pipeline inside `/orchestrate` is:

```
/mockup-lab generate → /interview (human review) → /mockup-lab iterate
      ↓ approved design
/ux-lab (code React component)
      ↓ built component
/mockup-lab review (Gemini VLM visual diff)
      ↓ match_score < 90 → fix code → re-review
      ↓ match_score >= 90 → done
/test-interactions (verify interactions)
```

| Skill | Role |
|-------|------|
| `/best-practices-plan` | Rules this skill MUST follow (read first) |
| `/review-plan` | Validates the YAML before `/orchestrate` runs it |
| `/orchestrate` | Executes the YAML with per-task dispatch |
| `/test-lab` | Generates blind adversarial tests (required per task) |
| `/memory` | Phase 0: check for prior solutions |
| `/assess` | Phase 0: read the target codebase |
| `/interview` | Gather requirements when goal is ambiguous |
| `/dogpile` | Research unfamiliar dependencies |
| `/mockup-lab` | Design generation (Stitch) + VLM review (scillm) for UI plans |
| `/ux-lab` | React component development with Vite HMR |
