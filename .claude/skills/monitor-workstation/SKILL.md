# monitor-workstation

Nightly workstation health monitor. Runs 8 probes to enforce storage rules, detect cache bloat, and verify drive health.

## Usage

```bash
# Run all probes (markdown table output)
./run.sh check

# JSON output with figure_data for /dashboard
./run.sh check --json

# Auto-fix safe issues (cache pruning)
./run.sh check --autofix

# Visual report via /analytics → /create-figure
./run.sh check --report

# Register nightly 4am job
./run.sh register-nightly
```

## Autofix (--autofix)

Only cache pruning is auto-executed:
- `uv cache prune`
- `pip cache purge`
- `npm cache clean --force`

Docker prune is logged as a recommendation, never auto-executed.
