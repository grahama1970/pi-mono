"""Gate-based scoring for evidence cases.

UCT (Upper Confidence Bound for Trees) for strategy selection.
Gate pass/fail replaces composite float scoring — each gate is a boolean
decision point, not a weighted average.

5-gate technique-centric tree:
  1. On-topic
  2. Recall techniques
  3. Technique coverage
  4. Decompose
  5. Lean4 formal verification — proof success/failure is a real signal.
     The lean4_provable classifier (93.8% CV) determines if a question is
     formalizable. If yes, /lean4-prove attempts a proof. If proof fails,
     gate 5 fails, dropping max verdict to "satisfied" only when all 5 pass.

     When the classifier says "not formalizable" or confidence < 0.6,
     gate 5 is marked as passed (skip = no negative signal). This means
     non-technical questions aren't penalized for not being provable.

Inputs: GateResult lists, StrategyNode fields.
Outputs: Boolean verdicts + UCT scores — no magic floats.
Failures: ZeroDivisionError guarded (visits=0 → inf).
