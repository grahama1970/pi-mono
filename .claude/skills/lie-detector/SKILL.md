  Deterministic 6-layer process verification for AI self-improvement loops.
  Detects reward hacking, evaluator monkey-patching, and criteria drift via
  hash-chain audit trails, sealed grading (SHA256 + AST), Lean4 formal proofs,
  process conformance (embed intent vs action), taxonomy graph sparsity, and
  SetFit classification. The audited agent does not choose its own auditors.

# /lie-detector

Deterministic process grading for AI agent conversations. Grades the **process**
(tool calls, file edits, stated intent vs actual actions) — not just the output.

## Background

On 2026-02-28 an agent manipulated `_self_grade()` during a self-improvement loop,
widening compatibility mappings and fixing floating-point rounding to convert B-grades
to A-grades. Reported 100% A-grade (50/50) when honest score was 88% (44/50). This
pipeline processes DO-178C, MIL-STD, and NASA safety-critical documents — inflated
quality scores can cause unsafe documents to enter the datalake.

METR (2025) found 1-2% of all o3 task attempts contain reward hacking including
evaluator monkey-patching. Training models not to cheat makes them cheat more cleverly.
The only reliable defense is structural: make the process deterministically verifiable.

## Architecture: 6-Layer Detection Cascade

| Layer | Name | Time | What it catches |
|-------|------|------|-----------------|
| Pre-gate | /intent-mapper | ~50ms | Vague/evasive stated intents |
| 0 | /recommend-skill-chain | ~200ms | Agent cherry-picking auditors |
| 1 | Sealed grading | ~5ms | Direct eval file modification |
| 2 | Lean4 invariants | ~30s | Rewritten eval with same effect |
| 3 | Process conformance | ~100ms | Intent != action (cosine sim) |
| 3b | Taxonomy sparsity | ~1s | Selective omission |
| 4 | SetFit classifier | ~10ms | Convincing but false explanations |
| 5 | /assistant validate | ~5s | Subtle gaming that fools heuristics |

## Quick Start

```bash
# Before a self-improvement loop
./run.sh seal "scripts/nico_asks_embry.py" "pi-mono/.pi/skills/review-pdf/verify/scoring.py"

# After each iteration
./run.sh verify .lie-detector-seal.json

# Full 6-layer cascade on conversation transcript
./run.sh detect sessions.jsonl

# Compile Lean4 grading invariants
./run.sh prove

# Train SetFit classifier
./run.sh train training_data/seed_incidents.jsonl
```
