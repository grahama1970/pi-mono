# /review-assurance-case

Multi-provider AI review of structured assurance cases using 47 checks across 7 categories.

## Architecture

Same pattern as `/review-code`, `/review-design`, `/review-paper`:
- Multi-provider (GitHub Copilot free, Claude, Codex, Gemini)
- 3-step pipeline: Structural Audit → Semantic Review → Final Verdict
- Session continuity with context bridging for stateless providers
- Memory integration (recall prior reviews, learn findings)

## Providers

| Provider | CLI | Cost | Session | Default Model |
|----------|-----|------|---------|---------------|
| github | copilot | FREE | yes | gpt-5 |
| anthropic | claude | paid | yes | sonnet |
| openai | codex | paid | no | gpt-5.2-codex |
| google | gemini | paid | no | gemini-2.5-flash |

## Commands

```bash
# Review an evidence case report (markdown)
run.sh review --file /tmp/evidence-case-reports/q01_report.md

# Review with specific provider
run.sh review --file report.md --provider anthropic --model opus

# Review JSON evidence case data directly
run.sh review --json /tmp/evidence-case-results/q01_result.json

# Full 3-step pipeline with intermediate saves
run.sh review-full --file report.md --rounds 2 --save-intermediate

# Check provider availability
run.sh check

# List available models
run.sh models
```

## 3-Step Pipeline

### Step 1: Structural Audit (Programmatic + LLM)
- S-01..S-10: Graph topology checks (every claim has argument, every argument terminates in evidence, no cycles, no dangling nodes, context nodes present)
- Quick pass/fail per check with evidence

### Step 2: Semantic Review (LLM)
- L-01..L-07: Logical soundness (valid inference, no fallacies, argument type matching)
- E-01..E-10: Evidence sufficiency (traceable artifacts, relevance, reliability, proportional to risk)
- C-01..C-10: Completeness (all threats covered, requirements traced, assumptions stated, defeaters addressed)
- CF-01..CF-06: Confidence calibration (explicit levels, no pseudo-precision, epistemic vs aleatoric)
- CX-01..CX-06: Contextual validity (operational context defined, evidence valid for context, adversarial threats addressed)

### Step 3: Final Verdict
- Aggregated findings with severity (critical/high/medium/low)
- Per-category scores (0-10)
- Overall verdict: ADEQUATE / NEEDS_WORK / INADEQUATE
- Specific recommendations for each failing check
- Comparison with prior reviews (if available)

## Review Categories (47 Checks)

| Category | IDs | Count | Type |
|----------|-----|-------|------|
| Structural Integrity | S-01..S-10 | 10 | Programmatic |
| Logical Soundness | L-01..L-07 | 7 | LLM |
| Evidence Sufficiency | E-01..E-10 | 10 | Mixed |
| Completeness | C-01..C-10 | 10 | Mixed |
| Confidence Calibration | CF-01..CF-06 | 6 | LLM |
| Contextual Validity | CX-01..CX-06 | 6 | LLM |
| Process Compliance | P-01..P-06 | 6 | Programmatic |

## Memory Integration

- **Pre-hook**: Recall prior assurance case reviews for same project/domain
- **Post-hook**: Learn review findings with taxonomy bridge tags
- Graceful degradation if memory unavailable
